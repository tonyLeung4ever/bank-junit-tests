# Bank Management – JUnit 5 Testing

This project contains a suite of JUnit 5 tests for validating the functionality of a Java-based Bank Management system. It covers key account operations such as creation, transfers, and withdrawals, with a strong focus on accuracy and edge-case reliability.

## 📁 Project Structure

Tests are located in:

src/test/java/org/example


Each test class targets a specific banking function (e.g., `addNewRecord()`, `withdraw()`, `transfer()`), organized for clarity and modularity.

## ✅ Testing Highlights

- ✔️ Developed **20+ targeted unit tests** using JUnit 5 to verify functional correctness and ensure expected behavior across various input conditions.  
- ⚠️ Included **edge case testing** for each feature — such as negative amounts, null inputs, overdrafts, and transfers between nonexistent accounts.  
- 📊 Achieved **over 90% code coverage**, ensuring deep validation of both success and failure paths.  
- 🧪 Utilized `assertAll`, `assertThrows`, and conditional logic to test both normal operations and error handling.  
- 🧩 Test classes structured for **reusability and scalability**, supporting future enhancements or refactors with minimal effort.
